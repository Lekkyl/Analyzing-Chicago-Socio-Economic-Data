# Analyzing-Chicago-Socio-Economic-Data
This is the final project from my Data Engineering Foundation course offered by IBM Skills Network. The project is about connecting to databases using python and analyzing Chicago Socio-Economic data in jupyter notebook.

## Introduction

This Python notebook will be used to:

1.  Understand three Chicago datasets  
2.  Load the three datasets into three tables in a Db2 database on cloud
3.  Analyze data in jupyter notebook

## Datasets

To complete the assignment problems in this notebook you will be using three datasets that are available on the city of Chicago's Data Portal:

1.  <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork22-2022-01-01">Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago</a>

#### 1. Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago

This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.

A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:

#### 2. Chicago Public Schools

This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. This dataset is provided by the city of Chicago's Data Portal.

#### 3. Chicago Crime Data

This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. 

A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:

## Introduction

This Python notebook will be used to:

1.  Understand three Chicago datasets  
2.  Load the three datasets into three tables in a Db2 database
3.  Execute SQL queries to analyze data

## Objectives
* Store dataset in database tables
* Connect to database
* Query database system columns to ensure Chicago_Public_Schools data is loaded
* Analyze database data

## Results Expected from Analyzing Database Data
* Total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table
* Community areas with per capita income less than 11000
* List of all case numbers for crimes involving minors?(children are not considered minors for the purposes of crime analysis)
* List of all kidnapping crimes involving a child
* Kinds of crimes recorded at schools
* Average safety score for each type of school
* List 5 community areas with highest % of households below poverty line
* Most crime prone community area
* Community area with highest hardship index (using sub-query)
* Community Area Name with most number of crimes (using sub-query)
